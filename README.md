	The purpose of this project is to 
	create a bot that searches through
	a select few subreddits at the end
	of each day to find top posts and
	port them into a .txt file. This
	will prevent me from spending too
	much time on reddit before bed and
	filter out irrelevant threads.

	The project is down using the
	praw API (Reddits API) in
	python.
